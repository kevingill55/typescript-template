# React + TypeScript Template Repo

Simple template repo for quickly spinning up a React and TypeScript application. Comes with the following:
* `react`
* `react-router-dom`
* `yarn` as the package manager
* `eslint` + a few common rules and plugins
* basic implementations of `webpack.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` files

## Commands
* `yarn` - install dependencies
* `yarn lint` - runs eslint against source files
* `yarn build` - generates a bundle of your src files and outputs to the `/dist` directory
* `yarn start` - starts a local dev server on http://localhost:3000
